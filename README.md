# I-StAR: Introduction to Statistical Analysis with R

This is a course on introduction to statistical analysis using R and
RStudio. The course is organised into different levels;

## Course 1 - Foundation of using R and RStudio and the Tidyverse

In this Course 1 you will get an introduction to the R and RStudio data
analysis platforms and . The course gives an overview of how to use R
for effective exploratory data analysis and data visualization. The
course covers practical sessions in statistical programming which
includes programming in R, reading data into R, accessing and installing
R packages, organizing and commenting R code and planning for data
analysis.

## Course 2 (2024) - Introduction to R and RStudio

In this workshop, you will be introduced to the R and RStudio data
analysis platforms. R is a simple programming language that enables the
effective handling of data while providing excellent graphical support.
R studio is a tool that provides a user-friendly environment for working
with R. The course gives an overview of the basics of R and RStudio. The
practical sessions will cover reading/importing data into the R
environment, accessing and installing R packages, and writing annotated
R code for data manipulation, analysis, and making graphical plots.

### Course prerequisites:

-   Basic statistics: Took an introductory statistics course at the
    undergraduate level.
-   Basic computing knowledge, such as, installing and uninstalling
    software.

### Computing requirements:

-   A laptop with at least 8GB RAM. .
-   Participants will download R and RStudio into their personal
    machines.
-   Instructions of how to download R and RStudio are given below.

### Download R:

-   Go to the R download site: <https://cran.r-project.org/>
-   Click on the link, which matches your operating system.
-   Download the current base version of R (R 4.4.1).
-   When you run the executable file, accept the default setting, (click
    next throughout).
-   Once you are done, you have R on your machine (look out for a blue
    R).

### Download RStudio:

-   Go to <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/> and download
    R-Studio for Desktop.
-   Follow the prompts for your operating system (Mac/Windows).
-   Once you finish your download, the icon for R studio is a white “R”
    in a blue circle.
