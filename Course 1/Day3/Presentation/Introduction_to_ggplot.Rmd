## What is ggplot

- ggplot2 is an R package for producing statistical, or data, graphics.

- Under the tidyverse family of packages

- ggplot2 has an underlying grammar, based on the Grammar of Graphics

- compose graphs by combining independent components.


## How ggplot works

- ggplot2 divides plot into three different fundamental parts: 
    - Plot = data + Aesthetics + Geometry

- The principal components of every plot can be defined as follow:
    - __data__ is a data frame 
    - __Aesthetics__ is used to indicate x and y variables. It can also be used to control the color, the size or the shape of points, the height of bars, etc….. 
    - __Geometry__ defines the type of graphics (histogram, box plot, line plot, density plot, dot plot, ….)


## Load required package

- We begin by loading the required packages. ggplot2 is included in the tidyverse package.

```{r , eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

```

- Set the directory

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("/Users/akamau/Documents/I-StaR/Course 1/Day3/Presentation/")

```

- Load the data

```{r}
bw_df <- read.csv("Data/birthweight2.csv")
names(bw_df)

```


## Why?

- To have an understanding of you data we normally conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) which can be graphical or numerical

 - Primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us before the formal modelling or hypothesis testing task

- Typical graphical techniques used in EDA for one measure:
  - Histogram (one variable continuous),
  - Density plot (one variable continuous),
  - Bar plots (one variable discrete)
  
## Elements of grammar of graphics

- Data: variables mapped to aesthetic (aes function) features of the graph.
- Geoms: objects/shapes on the graph.
- Stats: statistical transformations that summarize data,(e.g mean, confidence intervals)
- Scales: define which aesthetic values are mapped to data values. Legends and axes display these mappings.
- Coordinate systems: define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.
- Faceting: splits the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling).

## Aesthetic mappings and aes

- Aesthetics are the visually perceivable components of the graph.

- Map variables to aesthetics using the aes function, such as:
    - which variables appear on the x-axis and y-axis.
    - a classification variable to colors
    - a numeric variable to the size of graphical objects

## To build a ggplot

- Use the ggplot() function and bind the plot to a specific data frame using the data argument

```{r}

  ggplot(data=bw_df) 
  
``` 

##  

- Define an aesthetic mapping (using the aesthetic (aes) function), by selecting the variables to be plotted and specifying how to present them in the graph, e.g., as x

```{r}
#declare data and x aesthetics, 
#but no aesthetics
ggplot(data=bw_df, aes(x=bweight))
  
```  

## 

- Add ‘geoms’ – graphical representations of the data in the plot (histogram, density, bars). ggplot2 offers many different geoms; we will use some common ones today, including: 

    - geom_histogram() for histograms
    - geom_density() for density plots
    - geom_area() for area plots
    - geom_bar() for bar plots

- To add a geom to the plot use + operator. Because we have one continuous variables, let’s use geom_histogram() first:

- You can easily set up plot “templates” and conveniently explore different types of plots, so the above plot can also be generated with code like this:

## 

```{r}

#declare data and x aesthetics, 

ggplot(data=bw_df, aes(x=bweight)) + geom_histogram()
  
```  

##

- The + in the ggplot2 package is particularly useful because it allows you to modify existing ggplot objects. 

- The + sign used to add layers must be placed at the end of each line containing a layer. 

- If, instead, the + sign is added in the line before the other layer, ggplot2 will not add the new layer and will return an error message.

```{r , eval=FALSE ,  class.source="highlight_code"}
# This will not add the new layer and will return an error message
ggplot(data=bw_df, aes(x=bweight)) 
+ geom_histogram()

```

```{r}

# This is the correct syntax for adding layers
ggplot(data=bw_df, aes(x=bweight)) + 
  geom_histogram()

```

***

##

```{r}
# adding aesthetics to the histogram

ggplot(data=bw_df, aes(x=bweight)) +
geom_histogram(breaks=seq(0,5000,200), fill="dark green", color="white", alpha=0.9)  

```  

##

```{r}
# adding title to the histogram

ggplot(data=bw_df, aes(x=bweight)) +
geom_histogram(breaks=seq(0,5000,200), fill="#69b3a2", color="#e9ecef", alpha=0.9) +
ggtitle("Birth weight in grams") 

```  

## Density plot

- A density plot is a representation of the distribution of a numeric variable. 

- It uses a kernel density estimate to show the probability density function of the variable.

```{r}
# 

ggplot(data=bw_df, aes(x=gestwks)) +
geom_density(breaks=seq(0,45,5), fill="#69b3a2", color="#e9ecef", alpha=0.9) +
ggtitle("Gestation in weeks") 

```  

##  Area plot with ggplot2

```{r}
# 

ggplot(data=bw_df, aes(x=bweight)) + 
geom_area(aes(fill = sex), stat ="bin", alpha=0.6) 

```  

## Integrating the pipe operator with ggplot2

```{r}
  
# Make the with fill based on 

bw_df %>%
  mutate(bw_cat=ifelse(bweight<2500,"LBW","Normal")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=bweight, fill=bw_cat)) +
    geom_area(stat ="bin", color="#e9ecef", alpha=0.6) +
    scale_fill_manual(values=c("#69b3a2", "#404080")) +
  labs(fill="") + ylab("Counts") + xlab("Birth weight") +
  ggtitle("Birth weight in grams")

```

## Plot for discrete variables

- A bar plot is one of the most common types of graphic for discrete/categorical variables

- Each entity of the categorical variable is represented as a bar and the size of the bar represents its numeric value.

```{r}
  
# Bar graphs for categorical variables

ggplot(bw_df, aes(x=ethnic)) + 
geom_bar(fill="#69b3a2") + ylab("Counts") + xlab("Ethnicity") + ggtitle("Ethnic groups")

```

## ggplot2 themes

- Usually plots with white background look more readable when printed. 

- Every single component of a ggplot graph can be customized using the generic theme() function, as we will see below. 

- However, there are pre-loaded themes available that change the overall appearance of the graph without much effort.

- For example, we can change our previous graph to have a simpler white background using the theme_bw() function:

```{r}
  
# Bar graphs for categorical variables

ggplot(bw_df, aes(x=ethnic)) + 
geom_bar(fill="#69b3a2") + ylab("Counts") + xlab("Ethnicity") + ggtitle("Ethnic groups") + theme_bw()

```

## Themes

## Exporting plots

```{r}

my_plot<- ggplot(data=bw_df, aes(x=bweight)) + 
geom_area(aes(fill = sex), stat ="bin", alpha=0.6)  + theme_bw()

ggsave("Output/Ethnicity.png", my_plot, width = 15, height = 10)

```
